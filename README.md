Advent of Code 2021.

The first three days were throwaways.  No code for them.
Every other day shows the final result.

The testing library is 'speclj'.  You'll see it referenced in project.clj.
The java version is 1.8.  

As requested by the AOC team, I'll be adding solutions a few days behind, just to keep things "fair".
